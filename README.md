# SynacorChallenge
https://challenge.synacor.com

This challenge was given by Synacor at
php[tek] and OSCON in years past. Now,
we are opening it up to everyone!

This is a programming challenge, but
you can use any language you like. As
you complete sections, come back here
to check your answer codes.

The winner during each convention got
Apple gift cards and fame. While we're
not giving away physical prizes any
more, we still hope you'll find the
challenges fun and interesting!
